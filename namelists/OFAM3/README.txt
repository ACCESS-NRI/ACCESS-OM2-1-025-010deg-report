I've attached two versions of the namelist used from recent OFAM3 spin up experiments.

- spinup03 is the namelist that was used for the spinup that was the version after 
"ofam3_spinup01" which was referred to the in the paper...
Oke, P. R, Griffin, D. A., Schiller, A., Matear, R. J., Fiedler, R., Mansbridge, J., Lenton, A., Cahill, M., Chamberlain, M. A.,
and Ridgway, K.: Evaluation of a near-global eddy-resolving ocean model, Geosci. Model Dev., 6, 591â€“615.
doi:10.5194/gmd-6-591-2013, 2013.
The main difference between these experiments was that spinup01 was forced with ERA fluxes directly, whereas spinup03 used ERA atmosphere fields with bulk formulas.  

- ofam2017 is the most recent spinup with several differences.
