# ACCESS-OM2-1-025-010deg-report

Technical report detailing the [ACCESS-OM2](https://github.com/OceansAus/access-om2) coupled ice and ocean global model.

Also available via Overleaf: <https://www.overleaf.com/11449164wmwcrxynvgpx>
(to use Overleaf with git, see <https://www.overleaf.com/blog/195-new-collaborate-online-and-offline-with-overleaf-and-git-beta>).

After cloning or downloading you will need to run `RUNME.sh` before you can latex the .tex file with `gitinfo` set to `true`. This should only need to be done once.

This is a public repository, so our draft is viewable to anyone. If that bothers you, let me know here: https://github.com/aekiss/ACCESS-OM2-1-025-010deg-report/issues/4
